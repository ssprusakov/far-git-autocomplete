For plugin settings, see configuration (`F9` - `Options` - `Plugins configuration` - `Git Autocomplete`) and help (`F1`).

Download and install
====================

To install the plugin, download [the latest distribution](https://github.com/excelsior-oss/far-git-autocomplete/releases/latest) and unzip it into the `%FARPROFILE%` directory.

This shall place:

*   the plugin itself - in the `Plugins` directory (both x86 and x64 versions),
*   a sample macro command - in the `Macros\scripts` directory.

A macro command is required for invoking the plugin with a hotkey. The default one is `Ctrl+G`.
You can create additional macro commands to invoke the plugin with different settings; see help for details.

Alternatively you may download and update the plugin via [PlugRing](http://plugring.farmanager.com/plugin.php?pid=967).

To build the plugin and dependent [libgit2 library](https://libgit2.github.com/), you will need:

*   Git
*   CMake
*   Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017 or higher

Download the sources:

And build everything using "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017":
